This project uses ESLint integrated with prettier, which verifies and formats your code so you don't have to do it manually. You should have your editor set up to display lint errors and automatically fix those which it is possible to fix. See [http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations).
